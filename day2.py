# day 2 of python
# there are different data types in python like strings, integers, floats, booleans
# strings
print("Hello"[-1])
# this is called indexing and allows you to access individual characters in a string
# even tho you can you can put a number in a string , it will still be a string data type and won't be seen as a number
print("123" + "456")
# to convert a string to a number use int() or float()
# int() converts to an integer
#integer
print(123 +345)
